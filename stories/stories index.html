						"Der Schwanendreher", a name which was made famous by that Paul Hindemith's viola concerto, when translated verbatim into English, literally means "The Swan Turner". The original context of "swan turner" can be dated back to Medieval Times, which means a kind of cook's assistant who rotate the handle of a spit on which swans were roasting. Meanwhile, wandering medieval minstrels, or organ grinders, who play on an instrument such as the hurdy-gurdy (and providing embellishments and rhapsodies on the folk tunes), which has a handle shaped as a swan's neck. Thus, "Der Schwanendreher" is also used to refer to these musicians.
						<br><br>
						To what extent has "rotation", shaped human civilization? At the very least, people could not have invented the camera and the tape recorder if they had not been able to comprehend the wonders of "rotation". As we have seen, the early cameras and recorders required huge reels that rotated to allow the storage medium to pass through the machine and roll the recorded portion onto another empty reels. Such way of operating directly affected our language and created a tradition &#8212; when we are going to record, we say: "Carmera/Recorder, Rolling!"
						<br><br>
						That is where the "DSR" comes from &#8212; A group of musicians, rolling the cameras and recorders, lightweight and compact, are able to travel quickly from one scene to the next. 
						<br><br>
						<!--
						In 1951, a Polish engineer, Stefan Kudelski, just finished a prototype of his portable reel to reel recorder. At that time, it needs to be powered by rotating the handle &#8212; thus Mr. Kudelski literally became another "Schwanendreher". Kudelski give a name to his recorder, "nagra", which means "(it) will record" in Polish. Years later, the nagra recorders he designed were widely used in the industry for their reliability and high-performance recording capability, and some even became industry standards. Nagra IV-S, a kind of tape recorder that was made and produced in the 1970s, and which you can still see on sound carts now a days.
